 <h1> Create a repository on Github: </h1><br><br>
  Log into <span style="color:blue;">Github</span> , then click the + on the menu and select
  <i>New repository</i>
  <center>
  <img src="diary1Image/step1.jpg" alt="step1.jpg" >
  
  </center><br><br>
  
You will need to name your repository. You can choose the type of repository as <b>Public</b> 
(anyone can clone) and <b>Private</b> (only authorized people can clone).<br><br>
  
   <center>
  <img src="diary1Image/step2.jpg" alt="step2.jpg" >
  
  </center><br><br>
  
  Once created, it will lead you to the manual page for working with the newly created repository. And your repository will now have the address as 
  https://github.com/$user-name/$repository,
  for example https://github.com/PhamHuy211199/17130086.git<br><br>
	Your job now is to clone this repository to your computer by command git clone địa_chỉ.	
	
	<div class="border">
	<span style="color:green">$</span> git clone https://github.com/thachphamblog/hoc-git<br>
								Cloning into 'hoc-git'...<br>
								warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.<br>
								Checking connectivity... done<br>

</div><br><br>

Now go to the working tree folder (just clone repository) and try to create a file named README.md ,
 then use the command git add to put this file into the Staging Area.
 <div class="border">
<span style="color:green">$</span> echo "# 17130086" >> README.md<br>
<span style="color:green">$</span>git init<br>
<span style="color:green">$</span>git add README.md<br>
<span style="color:green">$</span>git commit -m "first commit"<br>
<span style="color:green">$</span>git remote add origin https://github.com/PhamHuy211199/17130086.git<br>
<span style="color:green">$</span>git push -u origin master<br>
 
 </div><br><br>
 However, after the commit is complete, the file that has been committed will still not appear in the Github repository, but you have to do one
 more thing by using the command <b>git push</b> to push <br> the committed file to Github. Note that <b> will need to enter your Github account and password </b>.
 <div class="border">
 <span style="color:green">$</span>git remote add origin https://github.com/PhamHuy211199/17130086.git<br>
<span style="color:green">$</span>git push -u origin master<br>
 </div><br><br>
<b> origin</b> means the name of the remote (see next article) and the master name of the branch, these two I will explain more 
 in its own article. Now you can check your repository on Github.<br><br>
